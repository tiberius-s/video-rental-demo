# Video Rental Store - A Domain-Driven Design Tutorial

Welcome! This project is a hands-on exploration of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and monorepo architecture. We're building a video rental store - think old-school Blockbuster - to learn how to structure complex applications around business domains.

## Why This Project Exists

Instead of diving into abstract DDD theory, we'll learn by doing. This tutorial demonstrates:

- **Domain-First Development**: Starting with business rules, not databases or APIs
- **TypeSpec for API Design**: Generating everything from domain models
- **Monorepo Structure**: Managing multiple related packages
- **Modern Node.js**: Using the latest tools and patterns

The beauty of DDD is that it helps us think like the business while building software that actually works for real people.

## What You'll Learn

### üéØ Domain-Driven Design Fundamentals

- How to identify and model business domains
- The difference between entities, value objects, and domain services
- Why business logic should live in the domain, not scattered across your app
- How to make the code speak the business language

### üèóÔ∏è Monorepo Architecture

- Organizing related packages in a single repository
- Managing dependencies between packages
- Build order strategies and workspace configuration
- Sharing domain knowledge across multiple applications

### üîß Modern Tooling

- **TypeSpec**: API-first development with type safety
- **npm workspaces**: Monorepo package management
- **SQLite**: Simple, file-based database for prototyping
- **Domain-first builds**: Let business logic drive everything else

## How This Tutorial Works

We've intentionally chosen a simple, familiar domain - renting videos - so you can focus on the architectural patterns rather than complex business rules. Everyone understands what it means to rent a movie, pay late fees, and return it in good condition.

### The Learning Journey

**Start Here**: If you're new to DDD, begin with [`diagrams/`](./diagrams/) to understand the business domain visually.

**Then Explore**: Look at [`packages/domain/`](./packages/domain/) to see how business concepts become code.

**Finally Build**: Run the project to see how domain-driven development creates clean, maintainable applications.

## Domain-First Development Workflow

The key insight of this project is **domain-first development** - we start with business logic and generate everything else from it. Here's how it works:

### üì¶ Package Architecture

Our monorepo has three main packages that depend on each other in a specific order:

1. **Domain Package** (`@video-rental/domain`) - The business logic foundation

   - Contains all business rules and models
   - Generates OpenAPI specifications from TypeSpec
   - Provides SQL schemas for database setup
   - Acts as the single source of truth

2. **Database Package** (`@video-rental/db`) - Data persistence layer

   - Imports domain models to generate database schemas
   - Provides type-safe database operations
   - Uses SQLite for simplicity in this tutorial

3. **API Package** (`@video-rental/api`) - HTTP interface layer

   - Imports the OpenAPI spec from the domain package
   - Provides REST endpoints matching domain operations
   - Validates requests against domain rules

### üîÑ The Build Process Explained

Understanding the build order is crucial to understanding how domain-first development works:

```bash
# This is the order that matters:
npm run build --workspace @video-rental/domain  # Business rules first
npm run build --workspace @video-rental/db      # Then data storage
npm run build --workspace @video-rental/api     # Finally the HTTP interface

# Or just build everything in the right order:
npm run build
```

**Why This Order Matters:**

1. **Domain First**: We define what the business needs before we think about databases or APIs
2. **Database Second**: We create storage that matches the business model
3. **API Last**: We expose business operations through HTTP endpoints

This is the opposite of most tutorials that start with database tables!

### üìÅ What Gets Generated

When you build the domain package, here's what happens:

1. **TypeSpec Compilation**: Business models become OpenAPI specifications

   - Location: `tsp-output/@typespec/openapi3/openapi.json`
   - Contains all API endpoints, request/response schemas, and validation rules

2. **TypeScript Compilation**: Domain code becomes reusable packages

   - Location: `dist/` folder
   - Provides utilities for other packages to import domain knowledge

### üöÄ Why This Approach Works

**Single Source of Truth**: Change a business rule in one place, and it updates everywhere.

**Type Safety**: TypeScript ensures your API and database match your domain models.

**Documentation That Stays Current**: Since docs are generated from code, they never get out of date.

**Testing Made Easy**: Business logic is separated from infrastructure, making unit tests simpler.

## Exploring the Domain

Let's look at what makes a video rental business tick.

### Core Business Operations

We've modeled the essential workflows of a video rental business:

**Customer Management**: People need accounts to rent videos

- Registration with personal information
- Discount percentage tracking (for loyal customers)
- Account status management (active, suspended, inactive)

**Video Catalog**: The movies and shows available for rent

- Basic metadata (title, genre, rating, director)
- Pricing information
- Availability tracking

**Inventory Tracking**: Physical copies of videos

- Each video can have multiple copies
- Condition tracking (Good or Defective - we keep it simple)
- Status management (Available, Rented, Retired)

**Rental Process**: The core business transaction

- Customers rent specific copies of videos
- Automatic discount application for eligible customers
- Due date tracking and late fee calculation

**Payment Handling**: Money management

- Multiple payment types (rental fees, late fees, damage fees, membership)
- Various payment methods (cash, cards, checks, gift cards)
- Transaction history and status tracking

### What We Simplified

Real video stores had complex business rules, but we've streamlined things for learning:

- **No Employee Management**: We focus on customer-facing operations
- **Binary Condition Assessment**: Videos are either Good or Defective
- **Simplified Discounts**: Just a percentage field per customer
- **Basic Rental Periods**: Standard due dates without complex tier systems

This keeps the domain understandable while still demonstrating important DDD patterns.

## Diving Into the Code

Now that you understand the business domain, let's explore how DDD principles shape the code structure.

### üéØ The Domain Package - Your Business Logic Home

**Location**: [`packages/domain/`](./packages/domain/)

This is where all business knowledge lives. Think of it as the brain of your application.

**What's Inside:**

- **Domain Models** (`lib/models/`): The core business entities

  - `Customer`: Who rents videos
  - `Video`: What gets rented
  - `Rental`: The transaction connecting customers and videos
  - `Inventory`: Physical copies of videos
  - `Payment`: Money changing hands

- **Value Objects** (`lib/models/value-objects/`): Business concepts without identity

  - `Address`: Where customers live
  - `Email`: Contact information with validation
  - `Money`: Currency amounts with precision
  - `RentalPeriod`: Time spans for rentals

- **Domain Services** (`lib/services/`): Business logic that doesn't belong to a single entity
  - `CustomerService`: Customer eligibility and discount logic
  - `RentalService`: Rental calculations and business rules

**Why This Matters**: When business rules change, you only need to update this package. Everything else follows automatically.

### üóÑÔ∏è The Database Package - Persistence Made Simple

**Location**: [`packages/db/`](./packages/db/)

This package knows how to store and retrieve domain objects, but it doesn't contain business logic.

**What It Does:**

- Imports domain models to understand what to store
- Generates SQL schemas from domain definitions
- Provides type-safe database operations
- Uses SQLite for tutorial simplicity (easily swappable for production databases)

**Key Insight**: The database schema is generated from domain models, not designed separately. This means your database always matches your business logic.

### üåê The API Package - HTTP Interface Layer

**Location**: [`packages/api/`](./packages/api/)

This package exposes domain operations through HTTP endpoints.

**What It Provides:**

- REST API endpoints for all domain operations
- Request/response validation using domain rules
- OpenAPI documentation generated from domain models
- Express.js server setup with proper middleware

**The Magic**: API endpoints are defined once in the domain package using TypeSpec, then automatically become HTTP endpoints here.

- Request/response validation (planned)
- Authentication and middleware

### üóÑÔ∏è **DB Package** - `@video-rental/db`

#### Database layer with type-safe operations

**Dependencies:**

- Imports from `@video-rental/domain`
- Uses generated SQL schema for database initialization
- Type-safe operations based on domain models

**Features:**

- SQLite database with better-sqlite3
- Generated `init.sql` from domain models
- Type-safe database operations
- Migration and seeding utilities

## Getting Started - Your First Steps

Ready to explore domain-driven development? Here's how to dive in:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+**: We use modern Node.js features
- **Basic TypeScript knowledge**: Helpful but not required
- **Curiosity about business modeling**: The most important ingredient!

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and explore the project
git clone <repository-url>
cd video-rental-demo

# Install all dependencies for the monorepo
npm install

# Build everything in the right order
npm run build

# Explore the generated OpenAPI specification
cat packages/domain/tsp-output/@typespec/openapi3/openapi.json | jq '.'

# Start the API server (if implemented)
npm run dev --workspace @video-rental/api
```

### Exploration Guide

**For DDD Beginners**: Start with [`diagrams/`](./diagrams/) to see the business domain visually.

**For Monorepo Learners**: Check out [`package.json`](./package.json) to see workspace configuration.

**For TypeSpec Curious**: Explore [`packages/domain/lib/`](./packages/domain/lib/) to see business models in code.

**For Architecture Fans**: Read [`diagrams/workflows/00-workflow-interconnections.md`](./diagrams/workflows/00-workflow-interconnections.md) to understand system integration.

## Learning by Doing - Development Workflows

Let's walk through some common development scenarios to understand how domain-first development works in practice.

### Scenario 1: Adding a New Business Rule

Imagine we want to add "maximum rental duration" - customers can't rent videos for more than 7 days.

**Domain-First Approach:**

1. **Think Business First**: What does this rule mean for customers? For the rental process?

2. **Update the Domain Model** (`packages/domain/lib/models/rental.tsp`):

   ```typescript
   // Add validation to RentalPeriod
   model RentalPeriod {
     startDate: string; // date format
     dueDate: string;   // date format - max 7 days from start
     returnDate?: string; // nullable
   }
   ```

3. **Rebuild and Propagate**:

   ```bash
   npm run build --workspace @video-rental/domain
   # This updates the OpenAPI spec, which updates the API validation
   # and database constraints automatically
   ```

**Traditional Approach** (what we're avoiding):

- Update database schema
- Update API validation
- Update documentation
- Hope everything stays in sync

### Scenario 2: Understanding Package Dependencies

Watch what happens when you build:

```bash
# This will fail because db and api depend on domain
npm run build --workspace @video-rental/api
# Error: Cannot find module '@video-rental/domain'

# This works because we build dependencies first
npm run build --workspace @video-rental/domain
npm run build --workspace @video-rental/api
# Success!

# Or just let npm workspaces handle the order
npm run build
```

**Learning Point**: Dependencies flow from domain outward. This enforces the architectural principle that business logic doesn't depend on infrastructure.

### Scenario 3: Exploring Generated Code

See how business models become running applications:

```bash
# Look at what TypeSpec generates
npm run build:tsp --workspace @video-rental/domain
ls packages/domain/tsp-output/@typespec/openapi3/

# The generated OpenAPI spec contains:
# - All your business models as JSON schemas
# - API endpoints with proper HTTP methods
# - Validation rules from your domain constraints
# - Documentation from your TypeSpec comments
```

## Quick Setup Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies for all workspaces
npm install

# Build all packages in correct order (domain ‚Üí db ‚Üí api)
npm run build

# Test cross-package imports work correctly
npm run build --workspace @video-rental/api
```

## Helpful Commands

## Workflow Architecture Summary

### üèóÔ∏è **Domain-First Development Pattern**

This project implements a **domain-first monorepo architecture** where:

1. **Domain Package** (`@video-rental/domain`) serves as the single source of truth
2. **API Package** (`@video-rental/api`) imports domain contracts and implements REST endpoints
3. **DB Package** (`@video-rental/db`) imports domain models and generates database schema

### üì¶ **Package Dependency Graph**

```text
Domain Package (TypeSpec + TypeScript)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Exports: getOpenApiSpec(), generateSqlSchema()
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Generates: OpenAPI spec, Type declarations
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Used by: ‚Üì
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ API Package ‚Üí Import domain contracts
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DB Package  ‚Üí Import schema generators
```

### üîÑ **Build & Development Flow**

```bash
# 1. Domain changes trigger cascade updates
npm run build --workspace @video-rental/domain

# 2. API package gets updated contracts automatically
npm run build --workspace @video-rental/api

# 3. DB package gets updated schema
npm run build --workspace @video-rental/db

# Or build all at once in correct order:
npm run build:all                     # domain ‚Üí db ‚Üí api
```

**Key Benefits:**

- ‚úÖ **Single Source of Truth**: Domain models define everything
- ‚úÖ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration across packages
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Propagation**: Domain changes update API and DB automatically
- ‚úÖ **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with defined interfaces
