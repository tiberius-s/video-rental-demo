    UI->>API: GET /rentals/active?copyId={copyId}
    API->>DB: Find active rental

        API->>UI: Error: No active rental
        UI->>S: Invalid return

        S->>S: Inspect video condition
        note over S: Physical inspection of returned copy

        S->>UI: Enter condition assessment
        note over S, UI: Good or Defective only

        alt Video in Good condition

            API->>PDB: Calculate any late fees
            PDB->>API: Late fee amount (if overdue)

            API->>DB: Update rental status to Returned
            API->>IDB: Update copy status to Available
            API->>IDB: Update copy condition to Good

            DB->>API: Rental updated
            IDB->>API: Inventory updated

            alt Late fees apply
                API->>DB: Create payment record for late fee

                UI->>S: Return complete
            end

        else Video is Defective
            UI->>API: POST /rentals/{id}/return
            note over UI, API: {condition: "Defective", returnDate: now}

            API->>PDB: Calculate late fees + damage fee
            PDB->>API: Total fees due

            API->>DB: Update rental status to Returned
            API->>IDB: Update copy status to Retired
            API->>IDB: Update copy condition to Defective

            API->>DB: Create payment record for damage

            DB->>API: Records updated
            API->>UI: Return processed + damage fee due
            UI->>S: Show damage fee to customer

## Return Status Transitions

```mermaid

    [*] --> Active: Rental created
    Active --> Overdue: Past due date
    Active --> Returned: Returned on time
    Overdue --> Returned: Returned late
    Returned --> [*]: Process complete

    note right of Returned: Copy condition affects inventory status
```

## Condition Assessment Impact

```mermaid

    A[Video Returned] --> B{Condition Assessment}
    B -->|Good| C[Copy status: Available]
    B -->|Defective| D[Copy status: Retired]
    C --> E[Available for next rental]
    D --> F[Removed from circulation]
    D --> G[Damage fee applied]

## Key Features

1. **Simplified Conditions**: Only `Good` or `Defective` assessment needed
2. **Automatic Fee Calculation**: Late fees calculated based on return date
3. **Inventory Management**: Copy status updated based on condition
4. **Damage Handling**: Defective copies retired from circulation
5. **Payment Integration**: Fees automatically recorded for collection

## Business Rules

- **Late Fee Calculation**: Based on days overdue Ã— daily rental rate
- **Damage Assessment**: Staff makes binary decision on copy condition
- **Copy Retirement**: Defective copies cannot be rented again
- **Fee Collection**: Fees recorded but collected separately via payment workflow
