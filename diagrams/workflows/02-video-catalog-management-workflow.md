# Learning Video Catalog Management - The Foundation of Your Business

## Why Video Catalog Management Is Essential Learning

Every rental business starts with **what can we rent?** Video catalog management teaches you how to organize, maintain, and present business inventory through Domain-Driven Design principles.

**What You'll Learn**: Master data management, business validation rules, search capabilities, and how real-time inventory connects to customer-facing catalogs.

## The Business Reality of Video Catalogs

Your catalog is more than a database - it's your business storefront. Every video catalog decision affects:

- What movies can customers rent? (business offerings)
- How do customers find what they want? (user experience)
- Are there enough copies available? (inventory reality)
- What's the rental price? (business revenue)
- Is this video still available to rent? (business status)

**The Goal**: Maintain an accurate, searchable catalog that connects seamlessly with physical inventory while making it easy for customers to find great movies.

## Essential Business Rules (Catalog Logic)

These rules keep your catalog organized and accurate:

- **Unique Video Titles**: No duplicate movies in the catalog (customer confusion prevention)
- **Complete Movie Information**: Genre, rating, description, rental price required (customer decision support)
- **Real-Time Availability**: Catalog shows current copy availability from inventory (no disappointments)
- **Active Status Management**: Videos can be Active, Inactive, or Discontinued (business lifecycle)
- **Pricing Consistency**: Clear rental rates for all active videos (transparent pricing)
- **Searchable Organization**: Categories and ratings help customers find movies (business discoverability)
