# Learning Domain-Driven Design Through Diagrams

Welcome to the visual learning center! This folder contains diagrams and documentation that teach Domain-Driven Design concepts through a familiar business domain - video rental.

## Why Start Here?

Before diving into code, it's helpful to understand the business domain visually. These diagrams answer fundamental questions:

- **What does the business do?** (Entity relationships and workflows)
- **How do the pieces fit together?** (System architecture and dependencies)
- **What happens when customers interact with the system?** (Sequence diagrams)

Think of this as your business analysis before writing any code.

## Your Learning Path

### üå± **Start Here: Understanding the Business**

1. **[Entity Relationship Diagram](./ERD.md)** - See the core business entities and how they relate

   - What is a Customer? A Video? A Rental?
   - How does money flow through the system?
   - What business rules govern these relationships?

2. **[Domain-Driven Design Implementation](./DDD-IMPLEMENTATION.md)** - Learn how business concepts become code
   - Value objects vs entities - what's the difference?
   - Domain services - where business logic lives
   - How TypeSpec helps model business domains

### üîÑ **Then Explore: Business Processes**

1. **[Workflow Documentation](./workflows/)** - See how business operations actually work

   - How do customers register?
   - What happens during a video rental?
   - How are overdue videos handled?

2. **[Workflow Interconnections](./workflows/00-workflow-interconnections.md)** - Understand the big picture
   - How do different business processes depend on each other?
   - Where are the integration points?
   - What drives what in the system?

### üé¨ **Finally Experience: Interactive Flows**

1. **[Sequence Diagrams](./sequence/)** - Watch the system in action
   - Step-by-step customer interactions
   - Error handling and edge cases
   - How business rules get enforced in real scenarios

- **Customer Registration**: Streamlined customer onboarding
- **Video Catalog Management**: Content and metadata management
- **Rental Creation**: Complete rental workflow with discount integration
- **Return Processing**: Simplified condition handling
- **Overdue Management**: Automated notification system
- **Payment Processing**: Multi-type payment handling
- **Inventory Management**: Copy lifecycle without maintenance complexity
