- this project is an npm workspace
- each package is an ES module
- TypeScript is used for type safety and development
- as a workspace, I expect best practices for package management and working configurations across all packages
- package/domain contains the domain model and TypeSpec definitions
- package/api contains the API implementation
- docs contains the documentation and diagrams
- when writing and running scripts, create a node script file with the logic and run it via npm with the tsx loader
- when refactoring, I expect you to maintain the same functionality and improve the code quality
- avoid writing or invoking scripts with `node -e`
- you don't need to compile the tsp for testing unless a tsp file is modified
- when you create test or backup files, I want those deleted at the end
- project was put together with node 22, so use the best modern methods when called for
- use the native test framework, 'node:test' for unit tests, and combine 'node:test' with fetch when functional tests are needed for the API
